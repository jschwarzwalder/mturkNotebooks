nlp-input-text-102, "In a recent review, I complained about the lack of sturdiness of modern toys.  However, this play house is sturdy and seems as though it would provide many years of play to several generations of children.  The play house is also pretty, and large enough that you could stuff a lot of things into it.The only complaint I have about this play house is the lack of pirate-related stuff to go into it.  You do get some blocky figures and cannons, but no pirate treasure, no steering wheel, no little pirate swords, or anything similar.  I suppose that if you were trying to give this play house to a small child, the lack of small parts could be an advantage.  However, if I were a small child, I would be asking mom and dad for stuff to go into my pirate play house.If you are looking for a play house for a small boy or girl, this play house is a winner from the perspective that it seems like it would take a lot of abuse.  On the flip side, it includes very few features, so you end up populating the play house with other toys you have.  This play house begs for some sort of add on feature or set(s) that allow a child to expand play possibilities.Enjoy!"

It worked well both times, but there a definitely cards in it that can incite some arguments if you happen to be playing with certain people who can't laugh at themselves a bit. I would recommend you get the expansions as they will help to keep the game fresh and give you the option to create your own cards. After a few plays with just the base set, the same cards will eventually come up and the laughter can die down if you can't come up with fresh combos. It's a fun game though and I really enjoy it with my family especially."

And yes, they don't even roll all that great on carpet either but well enough that you can push it and it will move a few feet. Has this affected my son's enjoyment of it? Sure doesn't seem like it. I bought this for him at about a year old. He's been playing with it for a year now and he still enjoys it. That (his enjoyment) being the point I have to give it five stars overall and I like that it was made in USA. He also is sometimes pretty rough with it and pushes down on it while zooming around the living room and it's help up, the only "damage" to it are some cosmetic modifications he made to it courtesy of his crayola crayons (also made in USA)."

nlp-input-text-112, "This was a birthday gift for my four year old son. He loves to play hide and seek so we thought he would like this game. After reading all the wonderful reviews, I was excited to order it for him. He has a birthday right after Christmas so finding something else for him is sometimes difficult. He liked it at first, but really he hasn't played with it much since. I know the age recommendation is 6+ BUT my one and a half year old LOVES playing with them. At first, she was a little scared of them when they made a noise but she got over it in a couple days. She brings them to me often as says &#34;high&#34; for me to hide them. The only thing negative I have to say is that it does take almost three minutes before they start to make noise as a hint for you to find them. I guess I just assumed it would have been faster. I actually hide them for my kids in the house and they forget about them and go about playing with other toys until they hear them, then they go hunt. I guess the long wait time would be better if playing outside or with a bunch of kids who are hiding them and take a long time to finally pick a hiding spot. I can say that my daughter has dropped them A LOT on our tile floor and they are still working great, so they definitely seem well made. Hopefully these will be more of a hit with my son once spring/summer is here and we can play with them outside."

nlp-input-text-115, "This, like most ThinkFun games, is a solitary thinking game, but my kids really like it.  To play, you pick a card and set up the game pieces accordingly.  Your goal is to get your man from his starting location to the designated ending location.  He can walk along crates and tip them over to get to the next crate (the tipping is quite gratifying to the kids for some reason).  Once a crate is tipped over, you can't move it, although you may find yourself backtracking over it.  If you are stuck, the answers are printed on the back of each card. When you are finished, toss it into the handy storage bag until the next time you or your kids need an interesting diversion.It is not specifically an educational game, but it does provides practice in visualization, spatial skills, planning a few moves ahead, and thinking!I do wish there was an easy way to get replacement pieces.  We've lost a couple of crates, but can still play most of the cards.All in all, a great game."
nlp-input-text-116, "This is far more than I had expected.  I thought it was a simple paint by numbers kind of thing with caked watercolors.  It's not that.  It's liquid watercolors with an eyedropper for precise control on how much goes into the pallet, a good, reusable plastic pallet with 20 compartments, a piece of heavy watercolor paper for testing colors, and three fabulous panels on heavy paper.The paintbrush is double sided, which is odd but not horrible.The paints supplied are blue, red, purple (in the red family), yellow, and black.  Most purists say you don't need white -- just let the white of the paper through.  I'm a fan of white for when I want a pastel effect -- pink is not quite the same thing as pale red -- but that's very much a minority opinion.The paper feels like a smooth cold press.  That means it has more texture (and more grip) than a hot press, but not so much texture that it becomes a design element in its own right.This can serve as both an arts and crafts hobby kit, and as a serious introduction to the art of watercolor painting.  The instructions are well suited for a first lesson.  It's supposed to be for ages 8 - 13, but it's sophisticated enough, and engaging enough, to be fun for teenagers and adults as well."

nlp-input-text-122, "My daughter (5) is quite the tea party buff. She has even been able to convince her two brothers to join her for tea parties and has thrown "official" tea parties for her friends. She was my official tester for this set. This set definitely has the cuteness factor you would expect in a tea set. It also food grade, meaning you can put drinks (like lemonade) in the cups, food on the plates, etc. This is important because some manufacturers are stupid enough to put tea sets on the market using materials that aren't food grade - so kids can't really use them!The set worked well. Don't overfill the teapot or it can leak, but this is still good for a "party".These are NOT dishwasher safe. Not a bad thing since clean up is a fun and important part of any tea party anyway (and washing dishes instead of just throwing them in the dishwasher should happen sometimes). They also should NOT have hot liquids or be placed in the microwave. Now, this isn't a bad thing since this set is recommended for kids as young as 3 and I can't see serving a 3 year old tea with boiling water.We didn't quite get the "sunny patch" design. It has cute butterfly designs and the teapot is kind of a flower, but for "Sunny Patch" we were thinking Mrs. Spider's Sunny Patch so we were kind of thrown off by that.Overall a really good tea set that a child can actually use (no BPA or PVC - THANK YOU!!!). Just be careful with it (no microwave, no dishwasher) and it should last a long time!"

nlp-input-text-126, "I purchased two packs of these for two wonderful little girls' Christmas.  I manually sorted all the colors into individual compartments of Plano storage boxes (B000E3C3OE) so, over the coarse of a couple of hours, I handled pretty much every single band in the bag.  I did not count them so I can't comment on the accuracy of the number listed but the volume of the package seems consistent when compared to the smaller packs I have been buying.  No bad smells or anything to report as some others have mentioned but here are a few things of note;  Both bags were almost dead on with the amount of each color received.  Lots of green, white, black and orange.  Not so many red, pink, dark blue.  Other colors kind of average the others.  There seems to be a problem with the machine cutting the bands, especially green and light blue.  Both packages help a large number of broken green bands and some that were still together but paper thin in one area.  Same with the light blue color.  Not as many broken but several thin ones in both bags.  Overall, the sizes are fairly consistent but you'll occasionally run into a really thick one or a thinner than average one.  They still work fine for their purpose and both girls absolutely loved them.  That and the low, low price add up to four stars from me.  If you're looking for a lot of bands for not a lot of money and you're not overly perfectionist, this bag is for you."

The lines are delivered well and the sound quality is good but I was really hoping for a wider variety of phrases and maybe the ability to Vaderize your own voice but no luck there.Overall, I'd give it a "cool--but overpriced.""

The warning label on the back of the package has a misspelling that states: &#34;Magnets can attach caross intestines and cause injury and death.&#34; The product I ordered is pictured saying Rattlesnake Eggs, Singing Magnets with an orange background. I got something saying just Rattlesnake Eggs with a blue & green background. The packaging online shows &#34;For Ages 3+&#34; but the one I got says Ages 6 and Up. Since there is nothing stating how to use the product, I don't know how to teach my kids to make a rattlesnake sound as the package does state it should do, or how to get them to &#34;sing&#34; as the packaging on the product I ordered and did not even receive states that could be done with the magnets.

Not to mention that without the (not included) toy ladder, the odds of your child being able to successfully knock down anything other then the fake television screen are pretty slim as the launch angle does not allow you to aim at an action figure standing in the ring.My recommendation, pass on this one, it is basically a glorified piece of plastic junk, that requires even more expensive plastic junk to use."

nlp-input-text-134, "Let me preface this review - I know NOTHING about Beyblade, nor the accompanying cartoon.  There is a whole "cult" following around this game and all the different Blades.  Mostly young male.I chose this game because it looked cool and like something my 7 year old would like.  Well, he LOVED it.  But we had to watch several YOUTUBE videos before we got the hang of ripping the tops.  The arena comes with three inter-changeable bottoms, which make the tops behave differently, so you can always be switching the play area up.  The tops I know, I know, they are Beyblades and the launcher contraptions - are solidly constructed of heavy aluminum and heavy plastic.  They are well made.  The arena?  NOT so much.  Cheap crappy plastic.  As are the rip-chord things.  This set comes with additional stickers, directions and a score keeping pad for tournaments.This kit comes with the bottom of the rung top-launcher and that was the one issue I had.  It took me a lot of practice and watching the videos to see exactly how this thing worked.  So that's my big complaint - they could have thrown in two launcher guns.Now, how did this game save the day?  My kids are in-between summer camps right now and stuck in horrible, boring, snoring daycare - literally a parking lot all day.  Very sad, I know, I know.  My son brought this game in and it was played with for HOURS by all ages - K through 6 and all kids, everyone wanted to take a turn playing and they played it for over 4 hours.  The cheap crappy arena - held up brilliantly!  It didn't even have one scratch on it at the end of the day.  The tops?  Well, they looked battled - but were perfectly fine.  All the kids enjoyed playing and watching the tournaments.  Some kids have slick moves - like sliding into the arena.  It made for a very fun morning in an otherwise stifling, soul-sucking setting.I gave some stars for educational value because I think it teaches patience - your turn will come - and you also have to fill out the tournament diagrams - which is a bit like good old fashioned FINAL FOUR rankings.I might go ahead and add another two blades to the set - oh noooo, I'm becoming a Beyblade cult member!"

nlp-input-text-137, "This is different from the other Knight dress-up costumes because it's a set of molded plastic pieces.  My son wore it for Halloween, and some thought he was a gladiator.  He actually wore it over a cheap fabric/mesh hooded top that was designed to look like chainmail, so the effect of both put together was quite good.  He won a costume contest at a friend's party.  He loves the set, and there are so many pieces that it's a great value--chest plate, shield, sword (with scabbard) and helmet.  If you had only one knight dress-up set, this one will last. (I'm afraid to put the chainmail costume in the wash).DETAILS:  The chest plate has 2 plastic straps that go from the shoulder to the hip.  The strap attachment works like a backpack strap attachment--you feed the strap up and down through 2 horizontal slots.  Because the straps are plastic, it is not easily adjustable, and you can't tighten by simply pulling on the long tail once you've fed it through.  To keep it on a small child, you should criss-cross the straps in the back, otherwise, it'd be too loose and difficult to keep on.  With the straps criss crossed, it can be a little tricky to for a child to pull on over his head, and if it's adjusted too tight, the hard plastic will dig into the child's neck/collar bone.  Find a comfortably loose position, and keep it there.  The straps won't slip.  Once we found the right length, my 4 year old had no problem slipping it over his head by himself (and off again).  The helmet is too large for most children.  I rigged a ribbon chin strap with just a little elastic on the ends, and it was enough to keep the helmet from falling off."

The instructions (all pictures, which is good) involve 50 steps.  We worked together on the first half, but then his interest in the assembly process decreased .  (Of course, I had to see it all the way through.) Plus, some of the snap-together parts (the yellow rods in the picture) take a fair bit of strength to snap in, especially when the connection point is horizontal. And attaching the final parts (the top section with the Bat signal) can cause some other parts to come loose, because the structure can't take a lot of downward pressure.I didn't even try any of the alternate configurations.

Cupid has made the jump from a minor Monster High character to an Ever After High Rebel &#8211; and I am so glad she did.  This doll is a beautiful addition to the EAH lineup.  Cupid is all about pink, and her other colors are white, bronze and black.  Cupid has bright turquoise blue eyes that are enhanced by her metallic pink eye makeup and long lashes.  A cute detail she has is that her eyes also have white heart-shaped highlights.  Her lips are pale pink with a darker pink heart painted on the middle.  Her long, curled pink hair and curled bangs are the same bright pink shade as her MH version, and the pink shade is quite a bit more intense than it appears in the promotional photo.  Her styling and expression are very sweet and less severe than the MH version.  Cupid is a darling.Cupid is the daughter of Eros, the winged god of love, so feather and heart details abound.  Her dress has a pink halter top with little metallic bronze wing cap details over her shoulders.  The skirt of her dress is a print of pink sky and white clouds overlaid with metallic pink heart tipped arrows.  The skirt is trimmed in black lace, and the top and front of the dress have a transparent bronze net apron.  Cupid also wears black fishnet stockings and gold winged high heel shoes.Cupid has many accessories, but the best are her removable wings.  The wings are white with bronze antiquing to bring out the pattern of the feathers.  The wings hang from the back of her neck by a collar that is shaped like an arrow.  Cupid holds her bronze bow and filigree covered quiver of arrows.  She wears black heart shaped earrings, a feather bracelet, black arrow ring, bronze and black feather belt, and a bronze headband with a pink heart and arrow decoration.Cupid comes with a doll stand, key shaped hair brush and fold out &#8220;bookmark&#8221; bio with details of her story.  Cupid is fully jointed, and can be posed multiple ways for play or display. Cupid is made for gentle play and has several small parts that could be damaged or lost if care is not taken with her.  She comes in the usual amazing EAH packaging that is styled to look like a storybook and displays her tagline, &#8220;Loves a Happily Ever After&#8221;.

It requires a variety of skills to make it work -- creativity, hand-eye coordination, technical understanding, and patience. And yet, somebody lacking any or all of those skills can still play with it. Anybody can doodle aimlessly on an etch a sketch, but with practice you can make something really special. And then, with just a shake, it disappears forever, as if it never was! There is something mysterious and magic about that whole concept, which is part of the fun. This is a toy, it is a skill development tool, and it is an artistic canvas. There is nothing else quite like it. It reminds you that art, like life, is fleeting, and if you can't find a philosophical meaning in the whole thing, then you might as well just shake it up and have fun with it.

As the mom of two kids who enjoy K'Nex and lego, I am used to picking up and stepping on tiny little pieces of similar sets regularly.  But the effort on this toy far exceeds the enjoyment you experience by using it. It made 176 pieces feel like a thousand.

nlp-input-text-154, "brought two of these.  read review after review and was worried about it popping. my two boys are 6 and 10 and the same size (4'2" & 4'4" and forget their weight, but wear size 10-12 boys to give you an idea).  I got this a few days ago (thank you PRIME shipping!) and the 6yr old tried it out first.  he went flying a few times into the carpet, but got the hang of it within a half hour.  he loved it..was absolutely out of breath, so i know it was a workout.  his brother got to hop on his the next day and same thing...got the hang of it in short time.  well, that's all the did the rest of the weekend was hop, hop, hop back and forth....racing, fighting, picking it up by the handle and smacking each other...from p in the morning til 9 at night.  buyer beware!  lolonly con was that the balls were greasy out of the box.  and smelly.  i had read it on some of the reviews.  i just wiped them down with a couple clorox wipes before i let them play on them.blowing them up was pretty easy.  i found that using my mouth got it pumped up faster than the ball pump (that i had on my own).  but i used the ball pump to top it off before sealing.i'm sure we'll have lots more fun with these.  and if they pop, i think it'll be worth it to reorder another."

My 3 year old granddaughter loves Disney Princesses & asked for Snow White for her birthday.Disney Princess Princess Snow White Dollis from  the Disney Sparkling Princess collection by Mattel.She is the size of a Barbie.She can't stand alone; however her legs move at the hips.  Her knees don't bend.The front of her bodice is  sparkly, molded plastic, but the back of her molded plastic bodice is not sparkly.Snow White's hair is very stiff & shouldn't get messed up easily.Her shoes will not stay on.  We're thinking of using double-sided sticky tape to see that will work. If that doesn't work, we might glue the shoes on...then again, we might forget about the shoes & let Snow White go barefoot.Her skirt can be removed; the top piece of her skirt is sparkly.Snow White has a plastic tiara that seems like it can't be pulled off. Granddaughter's sleeping with Snow White now, so I can't check.Snow White's face is much prettier than it looks in Amazon's photo. Actually she looks better in person than in the product photo.Sparkling Princess Snow White seems to be durable & is a good choice for a 3 year old who loves all the Disney princesses."

nlp-input-text-157, "I'm not a good predictor of what kinds of toys our 19-month-old son would enjoy. He won't touch some things and immediately falls in love with others. Well, his grandparents gave him this Leapfrog Alphabet Pal and he took an immediate like to it. He even sleeps with it! And it's hard plastic. Go figure. His main attraction is with the musical tunes. He has learned to switch the selection to music and he then plays the tunes with the little buttons. So far, there's no action in the other modes, but he loves the music.Gary Peterson"
nlp-input-text-158, "Bugs are quality and preserved well.  Kids like looking at them with a magnifying glass.  I gave 4 stars because the acrylic scratches fairly easily, but the kit should last if you protect it."
nlp-input-text-159, "This is the Stormtrooper/Sandtrooper we've been waiting for. great sculpt, perfect dimensions, no more &#34;He-Man&#34; stormtroopers, looks totally screen accurate. the removable head to get the shoulder pauldron off is a great addition as you can strip it down for double duty as a harder to find stormtrooper, or paint the pauldron for a custom squad of individual sandtroopers. the accessories are great with good detail on the weathered weapons and the backpack. if you only get one figure from the black series, make it a Sandtrooper."
nlp-input-text-160, "I used these in birthday party gift bags, and the kids loved them.. They are pretty sturdy and just the right size for toddler hands.I will order these again!"
nlp-input-text-161, "The toy sounded like a great idea.  My kids love music, toys that make noise and they also love coloring, so this would be the perfec toy for them, right? Not so much.The brand name is reliable. The idea is cute. You can make sounds while coloring.  I didn't mind having to put batteries in the toy. I have three boys so I'm immune to the noise.  The coloring pages are adorable. I'm just not sure what went wrong.They (referring to my 3 & 6 year-old sons) played with the toy as intended for about 5 minutes.  That's it.  They they took the coloring pages to the dining room table and had a blast coloring them.  The board sits in a toy bin and has not been touched since the day it arrived.My advice is to make sure this is something your child really wants before spending money on it...even at a sale price. Even at 75% off.  In my case printing out coloring pages from the internet is more exciting to my boys than the sound board."
nlp-input-text-162, "This is really cute.  You can 'teach' it tricks and play two games with it.  One is a memory game, the other a reflex one.  It makes barking noises and plays two loud songs over and over, fyi for parents with frayed nerves.  After playing each game once, I was done.  I give it 3 stars because when you turn it off, it 'forgets' the tricks you taught it (unlike a Furby), making that part of it seem pointless."
nlp-input-text-163, "{{{As of today, August 25 2013, this exclusive Headmistress Bloodgood Set is a 'red hot deal' this week at Toys R Us for almost half off (available both in-store and online) making this a GREAT deal at $27.99, plus tax and shipping which would bring your total to around $37 and change.}}} I was completely swept up in the preordering frenzy, mistakenly thinking that this set would be only sold by TRU online, and not only was I wrong, but I could have saved a little money by waiting for the sale this week!!!  Wish I would have waited to catch this on sale (as well as the new Home Ick and Mad Science sets discounted last week), but oh well...We've owned this set since it was released in May and my kiddo and I both feel that Headmistress Bloodgood is an amazing doll, great quality as is deserved of any MH product. Taller than the average girl dolls, and with enough detail to her coat and the rest of her outfit. Her up-do will stay in place nicely, but of course if you're a collector you will keep her in the box anyway. Nightmare is a gorgeous horse with an equally lovely saddle and has had no problems withstanding hours of playtime.The only reason why this exclusive set isn't a full five stars is the lack of accessories. I LOVE the fact that there is another 'grown up' doll offered in the MH line, BUT there is no doll stand, no brush for either the doll or horse, no office/desk, nothing extra! What's worse, Nightmare seems like she was molded from discarded Barbie horse molds (we did a side by side comparison with a Barbie horse, but another reviewer pointed out the mold is from the Disney Princess horse line). These two characters deserve a better package presentation! Since this set retails well over what past offered sets have, I hoped Mattel and TRU would really wow fans. Love the Headmistress and glad I purchased, but kind of disappointed in the presentation especially for the price.  Definitely a MUST BUY at the sale price, but sadly not worth paying full retail plus shipping."
nlp-input-text-164, "My boys who are 2 and 4 love these ratchet racers. They are easy to use...NO BATTERIES to deal with. They are easy to wind and I would say the frustration factor is pretty low on this toy. My boys are not the most patient, long-term attention grabbing crowd. You have to hit them fast and hard with the toy's "how's it work, what does it do and is it fun?" If you can't get them in the first 60 seconds. Fugettaboutit. This toy managed to do it and held their attention long enough for me to cook a meal, so it's a winner in my house! Bravo!"
nlp-input-text-165, "This shoots very far. That is part of the fun of this gun. It shoots much further than most nerf guns.It is very easy to use and very intuitive.it is easy to load and easy to cock and easy to shoot. Like most nerf guns though, it is not accurate beyond a short distance.However, the one draw back on this gun is it seems to jam easier than many other nerf guns we own, and with two boys you can imagine we own quite a few nerf guns.The good news is there is this little handy orange dot on the side of the nerf gun by the trigger, you push on it and it unjams the bullet. It seems to work for us with very little problems.Because it shoots so far you have to imagine there is some power behind the shot. Part of the reason the darts shoot so far is they are very light. However, as several of us can attest to after being hit, if you are hit up close by one of these darts it can sting quite a bit. You would absolutely not want to be hit in the face with one of these at close quarters.Buy extra darts."
nlp-input-text-166, "I took it out of the box and tried to change the rows from flush to staggered to make the rubber band bracelet, and it broke immediately. On the other hand, it broke in such a way, that it is still useable. There are blue parts that allow the user to hold the loom together and add more looms to make more complex projects, and there are enough of these to hold the loom together even if it is broken. Decent mix of band colors included in the 600 enclosed. I'm still using it. Gives me something to do with my child who is enjoying another loom. And since I got it at Amazon for $3.60, what can I expect, right? If I had paid full price, I would have been mad, though."
nlp-input-text-167, "This was a gift from an older relative for my 7yo daughter, and I suspect that all the other kids in the extended family of the under the age of 10 received this as well.  Daughter enjoyed this set because it was a novel project and she loves markers.  Additionally the clear markers allow the kids to see capillary action and offers an opportunity for explaining the science behind the ink getting sucked into the marker base.We did not like the mess factor - we are almost ready to list our home for sale, including new neutral colored carpet, freshly painted trim and doors - and more, you get the idea.  Wish the relative would have taken this into account and waited until next Christmas to give this gift - it can be messy with the 3 bottles of non-permanent/but NOT washable ink.  The instruction page does indicate that the ink can stain.  Additionally, I felt that the ink colors were less vibrant than regular markers.Also, the ink was hard for daughter to squeeze into the measuring tubes.  Crayola wisely used durable plastic bottles with thicker plastic, but does make it hard for the younger ones to squeeze and therefore, we adults took on this task.  Also, putting the final bottom cap on was also difficult for 7yo to complete - she could get the first click, but never the final click to completely seal it shut.  We adults also helped with this.  The mechanism for this task (a lever) works well, but little kids have less leverage and strength.  Maybe would have been easier on the floor or a lower table.We will not keep the set and do not plan on refills as we are minimizing stuff in prep for a move and do not desire the potential mess.  Overall, a decent product that many kids would enjoy - just maybe not the parents."
nlp-input-text-168, "This game by GMT is a winner, a gamer's game to use the cliche. It's breathtaking and, simply put, the best boardgame I ever played.However, make no mistake: if it has a scoring track running along all four sides of the game board, this is a Eurogame at heart :)This is not a licensed product developed in German and translated to English. It was designed by GMT (Chad Jansen).And what a game this is. Full of options for the players to decide each turn (that's the main reason the games lasts more than three hours, I guess), a fantastic theme (the Ice Age is coming! Which species will survive?), gorgeous components (mainly in the new 3rd printing released June 2012), clear and explicit rule book. And what's best: six players can play it, a rare fact indeed for this kind of strategy game.There is some "screwing another player" factor in this game. So, people who don'tlike a certain level of confrontation may be put aside by it. But even so, you may ty to avoi d it in a reasonable basis and still win. But tototally avoid the confrontationwould mean sure defeat.A fter all, this is indeed a battle amongst species.DOMINANT SPECIES has all the fun of a great strategy game, without any really negative side. However, one must be prepared to spend between three-four hours of playing. As it is the case with the majority of games of this type, the experience of playing it is highly enhanced iy you play it with the full capacity of players allowed (in this case, six players).I'd also recommend to never try to play this game with people who are new to Eurogames or this kind of strategy game. It would be better to begin with a simpler game (like STONE AGE or VIKINGS), then try DOMINANT SPECIES another day."

nlp-input-text-176, "Fun, quick game.  I play this game with my 9-year-old daughter.  There is some strategy but enough randomness that anyone can win no matter the age differences.I actually wish the game would take a little longer because some games can be over in minutes depending upon which cards are drawn.  However, this is also good because this is one of those games you can play when you don't want to play a long game.  I don't think we have ever went over 10 minutes for someone to win this game (and probably not that long).I have never played with other than two players, but I think 3 or 4 players would probably make the game even better.Edit:  After playing this more with various peoples, it appears that at some point it just digresses into a person trying to make a straight line across the board and stopping his opponent from beating him by using cards to remove opponent markers.  At this point it just becomes a luck of the draw kind of game.  And then the game gets played less and less."

The Price per Brick ratio is fantastic, and it includes 5 main characters Batman, Robin, Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn. The play features on this set are above and beyond expectations. A coaster like cart ride, Batcycle, and even an extra Riddler head! This is a Toys R Us exclusive but if you don't have a TRU you can find it at Amazon. Brick and Mortar Lego Stores don't carry it but you can find it online.Of all the Super Heroes playsets being released in 2012 (including the Marvel line) Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape is the most creative, enjoyable, and engaging Super hero set true to film,comics, and television. This will provide your Children with hours of playtime. Seriously, kids can't stop playing with this set.. there is something timeless about it."
nlp-input-text-182, "It is hard to find a game that my entire family can sit down with and enjoy. Either game is aimed at the younger members or our family, or it is better for the older members. Usually the grown ups have to give in to the kids. But now we have Hedbanz and we all have a great time playing it.The rules are simple: ask questions of the other players until you guess "what you are". Older players will tend to ask better questions, but younger players will have much sillier questions and answers that can really throw the adults off track!Of course, it is hard not to be silly when you have a card strapped to your forehead by a bright blue plastic band. We all had a blast! Sometimes it pays to be only 7 ask simple questions that lead you right to the answer. At other times, an adult can get themselves way off track. It was a ton of fun and this is our new game night favorite.We do have one complaint though: it only comes with 75 cards. You'll probably only go through 20 or so cards in a 4 person game, but this still means that you will start seeing the same cards after your 3rd game. No such a big problem for kids, but if you have 2 adults playing the games could start to get repetitive after a while.Overall, I highly recommend this game for a family or group with a broad age range. Everyone will have fun and can play at their own skill level."

At only $30 at the time of writing this review it's really a steal to get such a nice stuffed animal/dinosaur at that price. To me I think it's high quality from my perspective but that remains to be seen how long it will last when a child plays with it. I got it for my three are old nephew because I want to be the cool uncle that got them something really awesome. The one thing I love is how big it is my hope is that he remembers it when he gets bigger like I remember some of my toys.So basically if you have a kid who loves dinosaurs this really is one of the coolest present I found on Amazon. And the box it comes in is pretty gigantic.Thanks for reading!"

Once that is out of the way, get ready to laugh, and laugh and laugh and then cry. We have played this with many different groups, and it is outstanding fun.Repeats are rare as the combos are almost endless. We also got the first expansion, which is great and even raunchier! The randomness and variety is the best part, to see what your friends come up with Example: Q: what was Michael Jackson's dying thoughts? A: switching to Geico.  Unfortunately some of the answers only fit with a handful of cards, and I find the expansion helps with this."
