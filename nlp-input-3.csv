nlp-input-text-200, "Beast Hunters Shockwave is one of the best!Shockwave returns in transformers prime more badass than ever.This is the coolest version of the Decepticon scientiest since the G1 days.Shockwave has a perfect blend of the beastly attitude combined with the signature G1 style.The head sculpt on this bad boy is amazingly done to perfection with quality articulation throughout the rest of the transformer overall.The detail in both robot and cybertronian tank mode is awesome as well with perfect prime series accuracy.The Cybertronian Tank mode is one of the coolest and improved vehicle modes for Shockwave since the G1 days as well.Shockwave comes with his signature Hyperflux Cannon for the series which has realistic spinning action that is very simple to activate by pushing the button on the arm.Shockwave uses the left tank tredd to connect to the arm for the complete signature look.Shockwave does come with some cool as hell snap-on beast armor that gives him a more menacing beastly appearence.The beast armor is optional to have on or off,so its all in what you think looks better.The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or displaying this gem where you please.The durability is excellent as well with secure ball joint construction and a solid build in either robot or cybertronian tank mode.All parts fit securely together during the transformation process for one solid constructed transformer overall.The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is mid-level difficulty.If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 you might need to help some in the transformationj process.Honestly Shockwave does have a versatile transformation that 5 and above can learn easily after a little practice.To start off disconnect the tank tredd from the arm.Next you rotate the legs around sideways as the legs then will rotate straight up.Rotate the shins and feet down then rotate inwards.The feet rotate down as the next step involves you sliding the feet forward.Rotate the chest piece down so it's between the legs as the head piece will rotate around.The back piece with the tank tredds rotate out as the two purple sections on the chest area slide outwards.The arm with a hand will rotate down and then in forming a L-shape.The arm will then connect underneath as the weapon arm will do the same above.The weapon piece will connect to the middle part on top.Reconnect the tank tredd and Shockwave is ready to roll into battle!In vehicle mode the Hyperflux Cannon is stationary with no side to side movement,but this is not a big deal for how awesome the overall transformer is.If you are a fan of Shockwave this is one Voyager class version that is a masterpiece of quality that will be a treasure in your world of transformers.Bottom line Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Shockwave is a well-made,high quality,10 out of 10 transformer all fans will enjoy.I highly recommend Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Shockwave to all transformer fans and collectors out there.Shockwave Rocks and Transformers Rule!!!"
nlp-input-text-201, "I bought this for a friend who had a toddler.  This pool has served so many purposes and it is very durable.  My friend has put it in the yard where her daughter plays and plays.  Her daddy complains that she loves it so much, she doesn't even notice when he comes home.  She has also taken it to the beach (Zanzibar) and filled it with water and her daughter just plays and plays it there.  She has taken it side of Kilimanjaro, set it up and filled it with water there and her daughter just plays and plays.  She and another toddler friend leap into it and out, splash each other to their hearts content.  It seems very safe and has lasted two years now.  Guess that is pretty good when it gets a hard workout all year long."
nlp-input-text-202, "This is a great game that everyone in your family will enjoy. The goal is simple---unscramble the phrase.We play this with our two children (ages 6 and 8). I was a little concerned that our six year old would not be competitive, but she has actually won the game before and does not find it difficult at all.The best part about this game are all the options. As an example, each player can have his or her own difficulty level. The phrases included are generic enough so that most people will get them. As a rule, if anyone knows the phrase---they have to help the person whose turn it is by letting them know the phrase. This is nice as some of the phrases are geared toward younger kids (e.g. "Nuetron", "The" "Adventures", "Of", "Jimmy") so the kids actually help us.If you enjoy sitting around the table with your family playing games---this is a must have!"
nlp-input-text-203, "Our 4 year old grandson will start T-ball next month and this was a great investment.Kids are very awkward at certain ages and trying to tell them what to do is not easy showing them is the key .Christmas day we had this ready to go he opened it and his dad and aunt showed him what to do and presto a star is born we think so anyway. This toy is worth the money works well for batting and catching.This  would be great for little girls who are going to play softball also.Only negative is it only comes with two balls and the extra balls are to expensive."
nlp-input-text-204, "My three year old twin daughters just received this set for their birthday and they haven't put it down since. It is made of durable, think plastic...not flimsy at all. It is great for pretend play now as they are too young to learn fractions. However, I have already started teaching them the concept of part vs. whole thanks to this set. The pizza box is a very thin cardboard so I am not certain how long that will hold up but the set itself looks like it will last years."
nlp-input-text-205, "My two-year-old is absolutely obsessed with vehicles, particularly school buses, so when I saw this toy, it seemed like just the thing for him.  It wasn't until after we got it that I really examined what it could do and I realized what a great concept it is.The vehicles can easily be split into half, and all parts are interchangeable.  This means my son can play with the school bus as is or we can take it apart and reconstruct it as a half school bus/half fire truck.  Naturally, the more of these sets you own, the wider the variety of mixed-up vehicles you can create.When two sides are joined, they can be turned, winding them up.  Once they're fully wound, you can set them down, push the button on top, and off they go.  I really like the button feature because, unlike conventional windup toys, these vehicles don't take off until my son is good and ready for them to do so.Because my son's younger than the recommended age, he does have difficulty getting the two parts together, but he has learned how to wind them up, thanks to his eight-year-old system, who also enjoys playing with them.  It's fun to watch my little guy put them on the floor, press the button, and then laugh his little head off when they take off.  They've been quite a hit with him, and I'd recommend them for the car-crazy little person in your life.  Oh, and their parents will thank you for buying a fun toy that moves but doesn't require batteries."
nlp-input-text-206, "Got this for my four year old niece for a craft to do on a snowy day.  We had a ton of fun.  There are three slightly fuzzy bobblehead kittens in this set.  There are a set of markers, sticky flowers, glitter glue and material to decorate the kittens with.  The markers were lots of fun as was the glitter glue.  The sticky-backed flowers worked well too.  The least fun part was the material that had to be glued on (and would not stay!)  But all in all, we had a blast and I think I will get these again for my other niece.  FYI I also bought and tried the glitter bobblehead dog set but that one was mostly glue-based without the other fun stuff and wasn't nearly as big of a hit."

nlp-input-text-208, "I just finished building this one, and wow, what project. The flagship (so to speak) of the second wave of LOTR Lego sets, this is definitely for fans of more complex builds. At least I found putting all the little pieces together a bit of a challenge. I had a few minor problems with the sail assembly and a few times I had to backtrack because I misread the pictures in the booklet, but personally, that's what I enjoy about Lego--the challenge and personal involvement.Tho, to be completely honest, the real stars of the show, as always, are the mini-figs, and wow, what a selection you get with this set. You get the three main characters, a good representation of the Army of the Dead, a couple of Orcs with their own battle wagon, and to top things off, they included a Cosair Pirate as well. Needless to say, one of the most generous selections of mini-figs I've seen yet. Also, if your a fan of little tiny accessories--treasure chests, wine bottles, loafs of bread, gold coins, spare weapons--there's plenty of that included too.In short, a really worthwhile set. The hundred dollar price tag is more than justified. If your a LOTR fan, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it. It's one of the better sets I've seen, and that's saying a lot."
nlp-input-text-209, "My 15 month old received this as a Christmas gift, and he loves it! He has some developmental delays, so he doesn't push a lot of the buttons himself, but he loves opening and closing the doors himself, as well as being enthralled when someone pushes the buttons for him. The story feature is good!Like some of the other reviewers remarked the kitchen side just has a door and 2 sliding items inside the fridge - wish it could have been a little more, but it is a great toy anyway!And I love that it has not just an on/off switch, but that it has 2 levels of volume (so the doorbell doesn't drive you crazy!).Overall, I say it is a definite winner!"
nlp-input-text-210, "One of the best games I have ever played, fast and fun.  We play during the time I cook and in the night before bedtime.  Fast and fun for all ages."
nlp-input-text-211, "I want to commend the manufacturers on what great detail they put on this figure. He looks just the way he does on the game. The double capes (hood and hoodless) were a nice touch. My only complaint is that his knees don't bend very well and I feel like I can break it. I would really like to see more action figures from the SWTOR game. For instance, Satele Shan."

nlp-input-text-214, "Got one green one for my 2 and 4 year old to share, or at least to keep the 2 year old from fighting his brother for the Maxi Kick Scooter :-). He loves this, but now that he's got the hang of it, I need to raise up the seat.  Initially it was a bit difficult to steer, but that's user error on my part, I couldn't quite line up the handlebar. What's a little weird is if the handlebar is facing correctly, the triangle plastic on the lower back base of the handle bar isn't front center. Hard to explain.  I think my husband fixed it so it's a bit better now. It's a hit and I hope this helps them for when they are ready for big boy bikes. Somehow our 2 year old has taken to this more than the 4 year old, or perhaps since the seat height is for him.  What would be great is for the seat to be easily adjustable like the handle bar of the Maxi Scooter, or some other balance bikes like the Shazam, is it?  In the end, I picked this because the tires never need pumping and the adjustability, but I sure do hope the Strider Bike company makes it easier to change seat height without using a wrench.  I also got him a blue Shark Helmet like this to use with it:Raskullz Shark Attax Helmet - Ages 3+"
nlp-input-text-215, "When I ordered this I thought it was more like a toy from when I was a kid, hubby says that was called a Spiro-graph?  It's not like that at all if you know which toy I was thinking of (I'm 36).With that being said my 5 yr old absolutely loves it!  At first I thought you were supposed to use the colored pencils that came with it to draw using the stencils, then I found the black pen with the very skinny tip.  Perfect!  I'm going to have to find more of those pens somewhere so he can draw in different colors.  No wonder the pencils kept breaking, but still - we have a paper full of multi-colored dolphins that he just loves!You can make so many pictures with this and after you use the pen for the stencil part you can use the colored pencils to color pictures in.  The pencils aren't the best quality and it only includes 3, we'll have to get him more of the pens and pencils for a Christmas gift.  If they have other themes of this kind of toy I'd buy him another one, too.  He loves the ocean themed one we got and uses it at least every other day and I'm sure he'd love another one, too!  This is great for those rainy days and we get to see what kinds of things we can make!  We've got lots of swimming mermaids with little shells and fish to go along with the dolphins and their fishy friends and starfish!  He loves it!!  I'd definitely recommend it to keep a smaller kid busy in a way  other than some electronic game all the time, this fosters creativity and that's great!"
nlp-input-text-216, "This is such a beautiful puzzle, filled with over a dozen different animals having a good time in their zoo. There's an added special touch: the box doubles as a tote, with a blue cloth rope anchored through small metal eyelets on each side.Regarding quality, the puzzle's soy-based inks are brilliantly colorful. The shiny surface of the puzzle will mirror surrounding light sources. The manufacturing process is noticeable, shown as slight bulges on several corners, but it doesn't detract from the fun. The pieces are rigid, but feel somewhat easily flexible. The tote-style box, as cool as it is, can be bent with little effort - mine actually has a couple of dents from the pieces jostling about from within during shipping, though I give the product the same rating I would give were the box perfectly shaped.If I had this as a toddler, I'd have loved this puzzle. I'm guessing a chunk of the cost is for the rope handle, but then again, that's one of this puzzle's two charming attributes; the other being the fun scene it depicts. Does it get any cuter than a penguin holding his nose as he drops, feet first, into the water? Only if there's an elephant giving a jubilant jaguar a bath on his back!"
nlp-input-text-217, "This toy was easy to put together.  All the parts seem very durable.  My daughter has played with this since day one and still continues to.  Her favorite is Twilight Sparkle.  It does come with small pieces that are easy to get misplaced.  That said, she uses other pieces and parts from her other toys as well with it."
nlp-input-text-218, "Well this has lasted a year at my house and it still in the same condition. Here is what it has been though...Animals lay on it, my sons sleep or it or use it as a stool, my nieces will come over and feels the need to practice her karate on it and sometimes I will use it as a pillow when I am laying on the floor. Yes it sure can take a beating and does not look worse for wear. Would buy it again."
nlp-input-text-219, "This toy is overprice. The animals are hard to get on the sink to talk, so the kids have a hard time putting them on to get them to talk, and they only say one phrase each, and even then it has had a few glitches, such as the lamb will be on the sink, and it will say what Stuffy is supposed to say..."

nlp-input-text-225, "Let's face it, if you have a 2-7 year old girl, they need a Rapunzel doll.With so many dolls in the marketplace, you need something to differentiate the wheat from the chaff.  The Disney Princess Color Change Brush has just enough of a "catch" to make it fun for the little ones.My niece loved this doll.  She showed it to some friends during a get together and was the hit of the party.  In order to change Rapunzel's hair, simply fill the brush with ice cold water and brush away.  Fortunately, this worked like a charm every time.As an FYI, this doll is about the size of a Barbie, so you could probably change costumes or use Rapunzel with Barbie toys."
nlp-input-text-226, "Bought this for my 3 year old grandson.  He loved it, but Thomas (and a Percy we bought from another vendor) both stopped working almost immediately.  Changing the battery did not help.  Seems to be a problem in the switch.  I emailed Amazon and they quickly sent out a replacement.  Hopeing this one works better."
nlp-input-text-227, "My 7 and 9 year old granddaughters love this!  They spend hours making bracelets, rings, and necklaces.  I did buy a larger plastic storage container to put different colored bands into to keep all the colors separated.  They got this for Christmas and have been busily making bracelets!  They have a 1 1/2 year old younger brother who puts things into his mouth - so, be forewarned.  This is not to be around younger children."
nlp-input-text-228, "When the instructions on a product tell you to insert play doh and then to push the lever down, you would expect that it would come out the other side of the lever exactly as it is supposed to. This, however, didn't happen with this kit. My daughter received this for her 6th birthday, and we put it together right after her party because she was so eager to play with it. We inserted the play doh into the soft serve section and pulled the lever. While some play doh did come down to make a soft serve-like pretend ice cream, much of it squeezed out of the side of the machine instead. We messed around with it for 20 minutes trying to figure out what we were doing wrong, and all we could do to make ice cream was to put a very little bit of play doh into the machine at a time in order to make the soft serve.And the sprinkle machine? Is a joke. You can barely put any play doh into the machine to create sprinkles with! The chip maker in the hamburger set was much better than this sprinkle machine is. And cleaning it is next to impossible, as the other reviewers have stated as well.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because my son and daughter did have fun playing with it. We used the scoop and had fun with all of the different molds scattered all around the toy. But all in all? This was a very poor design."

Ours also came with some kind of strange smell, but within about 24 hrs of letting them air out it was gone.  By the way, crayon wipes off easily."
nlp-input-text-234, "My 3 year old grandson played with this for almost four hours straight. I've never seen him stay interested in any toy for that long before -- and it's so great to see him using his imagination like that. Really great toy!"
nlp-input-text-235, "I purchased this for my 2yo.  It's a really neat set with a simple concept -- dry erase board with activity sheets that you slide under the plastic.  Realistically, my 2yo isn't very adept at writing or drawing - but we have fun as a family drawing things and writing out letters and numbers for the 2yo to learn and repeat.  I think we'll get several years of use from this toy - and I understand that Crayola has downloads so you can print other activities to slide under the plastic. The contraption stores the extra activity sheets in the &#34;behind plastic&#34; compartment with a little flip piece to lock the sheets in place. 4 stars because I have a feeling that the plastic flip lock won't hold up forever and it only holds 4 markers to the dismay of my kid."
nlp-input-text-236, "This is an adorable cook set, but the scale is really small! I love the quality of the wood and colors of the stain."
nlp-input-text-237, "My seven year old grandson immediately started playing with this on Christmas.  He had a bit of trouble keeping it in the air where he wanted as the controls are touchy but he was really enjoying himself."
nlp-input-text-238, "The product itself was excellent.  My kids really enjoyed making the shrinky dinks.  I just wish there was more of them per package.  They included the special pencils which was nice too."
nlp-input-text-239, "My two year old daughter is very imaginative, and is a huge Disney fan, so these figurines were practically made for her. She likes to pack them up in her backpack and take them to grandma's or the doctor's office. At home, she can keep busy with them for an hour or two at a time, and I love listening to all the little "conversations" they have with each other while she is playing. They're also great to collect, as Disney makes several different sets of characters for all the different movies.The only recommendation I would make is to purchase them at the Disney Store (or on their website if you don't have one near you) as the prices are significantly better there - at the time of this writing, Amazon has them listed for over $24. I just came from my local Disney store where they were selling two sets for $20 (they're normally $12.50 per set)."
nlp-input-text-240, "I bought three for the girls. They have gone through 3000 bands and made hundreds of bracelets and charms since Christmas. One broke a tip being used by the younger girl, but is still useable. The others girls are more careful. I bought another one recently to allow them to make belts and it was very low quality so I wish I had stayed with this one. It is easy to use, disassemble and put back together. It is great for long boring trips and waiting in doctor offices.Look on YouTube for videos. I only wish it came with two of the hooks they are constantly losing that tiny piece and having to search for it. Also buy twice as many rubber bands as you think you will need and give them out as incentives, you WILL need them. Example, Do the dishes, here is some bands, watch your brother so I can work, here are some more rubber bands, Valentine's gift have some rubber bands, etc. Entertainment value 100%., value for the money 99% (could be stronger material), brownie points earned 100%."

nlp-input-text-244, "We've had a bunch of magformers for years and thought this sounded like a good way to change them up a bit. The light up part is awesome! There's a number of standard building pieces included that this could be a starter set or an add-on if you already have some.There's one light unit (kinda wish there were two) that can be constantly changing colors or can be set to one color. It has a recharging cord included which is so much better than needing to replace the batteries when we forget to turn it off!"
nlp-input-text-245, "This is an adorable baby toy, with or without the batter operated features.The active features may be good for toddlers, but certainly babies can also enjoy the cute bear, as well. It appears to be perfectly safe, as the battery compartment sits inside a Velcro-closed pocket tucked into the bear's back, but if you worry you can take the batteries out while baby remains very small, and save the the action features for later.That, presumably, explains the manufacturer's wide age range on this item. Nice."

This is why we love the Tag system.This Tag pen is the key to the system.  Once you own the pen, here is what you need to do.-  Buy a Tag book or another Tag product. (They now sell maps, animal cards, puzzles, and games that go with the Tag system.)-  Plug your Tag pen into your computer using the USB cable provided.-  Set up you LeapFrog Learning Path for your child.  This allows you to track your child's progress and see what they are working on.-  Download the book (or other item) to your pen.-  Give it to your child for FUN!Here is how the pen works.-  Once a book is downloaded to the pen you child simple touches certain areas of the book and the pen reacts.-  Touch the words, and the pen reads the story to your child.-  Touch the pictures for sound effects that go along with the story.-  Each page also has a learning game that goes along with that pages.-  At the end of each book is usually a reading skill game with different levels.We love the Tag system.  No, it does not replace reading to your child.  We still do this every night as part of our bedtime routine.  That said, my daughter still loves that she can "read" on her own.  It is great for the car, on airplanes, and at times when mom is busy.LeapFrog makes a quality product and you are sure to find a TAG item that your child will enjoy.  My older son, who is a great reader still uses his TAG.  He loves the maps and the solar system Tag products.  He can touch on a state, country or planet and learn new and interesting facts.  Proof that this toy can grow with your child."

As it was a little difficult for my son to use the enclosed tool I helped him. You really need a patience to this kind of activity. Hint: wet the block with water to make the process easier. We have found 13 gems inside the plaster and each one brought a lot of fund for my son. Also he liked the process and finally started to dig some "caves" and "tunnels" inside this block.

Very cute addition to my daughter's Webkinz collection (she currently has 20). She named this one Hershey, since chocolate is her favorite food. This dog is soft, and sweet, and sure to be loved for a long time. She also can play online with a code on the dog's tag that lets you play in a virtual world of Webkinz.

He stands taller than X when putting both figures side-by-side.  He has excellent detail and wonderful articulation, capable of many heroic poses.  Like the X figures of the D-Arts series Zero comes with a Buster Shot, plus multiple face and fist configurations. I am really looking forward to the second series issue of Zero, with the squared shoulder armor and Z-Saber.  Pick Zero up and add him to your collection!  He's worth it!"

I was happy to find that they are nicely packed into bags of 8 - 10 pieces each (maybe 6 bags of mixed colors of the 2x2s, maybe 5 bags of the 2x8s--mixed colors, as well as a bag of bricks with eyes, a bag of thin 2x8 bricks, and maybe 6-10 long bricks and a few smaller base plates---don't quote me on the sizes and amount of bags--but there have to be about 12 or so prepackaged bags).Needless to say, I now don't have to count out bricks---I just have to toss a bag and possibly a few extra bricks into each child's party favor bag....and each child has Duplos to add to the ones they have at home.  And my son has a few more bricks to add to his collection.I ordered these from the Wizard of Math (fulfilled through Amazon for $44)---they came in a large brown box that had "Lego Duplos Education" labels on it  (item #9027, which is not found on the Lego website)--with photos of what is included (like normal)---so they are authentic :)  I am very happy with the set and would recommend it."
nlp-input-text-259, "Legos are great for kids in learning directions, spatial orientation, assembly, mechanics, etc.  K'Nex allows you do to a LOT more - we have theK'nex Swing Ride- 853 pcstheK'nex Double Ferris WheelAlthough this kit is rated 9+ for age is Our 9 year old had a hard time with some of the tricky parts and I had to pitch in.  It's also pretty intimidating in term of the sheer size, so there's that.I would have given it 5 stars except for the following:1) Some pictures in the assembly manual are kind of small making it hard to tell what's going on.2) Some of the track attachment instructions are basically wrong - they work but there are much better ways to connect the track.3) The tracks are not actually the same on both sides even though they appear to be.  The connectors do not hold if snapped on one way, but will hold if the track is flipped over.  This is fine with the flat track but you can't always do this with the curved track.4) Some pieces appeared to be missing in our set - a rare occurrence - our other KNEX kits were perfect on this.5) I had to tweak the design to get the chain to stay on the trackOverall the kids had a HUGE amount of fun putting this together (as did I).  I did end up making one significant change - just before the cars go back onto the chain I swapped the track - the green goes to yellow and the yellow track goes to green.  This now means that the ride, instead of being two separate but somewhat identical rides, is now one double length ride.I will try to add some pictures showing the key changes I made to make the chain stay on as well as to fit the track better.If you have any questions or comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!"
nlp-input-text-260, "Highly recommend this game for little kids.  Very cute and somewhat challenging (even for adults).  Had a lot of fun on the road with it."
nlp-input-text-261, "Learning Resources Pretend and Play Healthy Food Snacks Set is what my 4 year old wanted.  4 more words required."
nlp-input-text-262, "Just received it today, was fast shipping. This is good gift for Christmas or New Year for your kids. Love the quality of the product. Also the characters 5 for one price pretty good deal, i compared in local store first and decided that is cheaper to get it here."
nlp-input-text-263, "We bought this for our 3 year old daughter - based on amazon reviews.  She loves the game - we have played it over and over at her request.  It is easy to understand and quick and easy to play.  It is well made and constructed.  I would recommend this game for families and children."
nlp-input-text-264, "this game is fun...especially with people who aren't totally lame at drawing....the ones who were drinking too much were kicked out of the game because they couldn't muster up the coordination to draw well enough."
nlp-input-text-265, "This is a great product.  MY daughter is almost 3, at her preschool they have a several sets similar to this one.  I had been looking for something comprable to the ones she had at school.  The price on this is amazing.  I was originally looking on Lakeshore and I would have had to pay double.  This toy will be for her to begin experimenting with magnets and I think its a great starter set.  I plan to hide magnetic objects in a bin covered with rice or whatever and let her seek the items out, should provide many fun moments."
nlp-input-text-266, "We bought this for a 2nd birthday gift for our daughter and she gets a lot out of it. We have to help build the playground but she stacks the pegs and and the big monkeys and loves to send the little monkeys down the slide and crank them up to the tree house platform, and landscape with the palm trees.  She will be able to enjoy this toy for a long time as her dexterity increases and she can construct the playground herself.  I also like the fact that we can expand on this with other Lauri tall stacker toys."
nlp-input-text-267, "This bubble gun works great.  So great that I need another one.  Love this thing.  Great for kids and for grown ups.  When I feel stressed I go shoot my bubbles.  :)"
nlp-input-text-268, "My 3 yr old grandaughter is is of course the best princess ever.  She loves all things princess.  Candy Land is a staple for every kid. It's been around for years and will continue to be around for may more generations"
nlp-input-text-269, "My son loves these little packs, and they make great birthday gifts too.  He plays with them all the time, Lego is a great product."
nlp-input-text-270, "We opened this box with much anticipation.  My 9 year old and his friend spent an afternoon playing it, (occasionally having tops flying accross the table.)  They had a great time laughing, trash talking and setting up mini tournaments.  However now about a month later, it has sat in the closet, unplayed, for at least 3 straight weeks.I had never heard of these before being offered a reviewer set, but my kid sure had.  He knew that the tops were collectible and modifiable.  He could even describe the section in Target even though he had never played it. I was impressed as he told me how they can be reconfigured to have different fighting characteristics.  I am awed by the wisdom of the marketers to make it so you could always buy more accessories.In general, the toy is well made. We did have a little issue with one of the ripcords that is a little warped and catches in the top, but we fix it by occassionally bending the tip back the other way. Otherwise it was fun to play, it just doesn't seem to hold your attention for long periods of time.  For dollar to time used ratio, I would have gone with Legos."
nlp-input-text-271, "my 4 year old son is so into the show, gator boys on animal planet. so that's why i got this itemit is amazing! i only paid for $12 and the quality is fantastic. my son sleeps with it and while he watches gator boys, he imitate all the moves on tv"
nlp-input-text-272, "This is a great starter kit for kids who are using Knex for the first time. The mini sets are specific to build one thing,but this set promotes imagination withour stress"
nlp-input-text-273, "I purchased these to use on my son's first birthday Mickey Mouse themed cake. They were the perfect size and stood up nicely in the icing."
nlp-input-text-274, "I have owned this bubble machine for a few months and also had problems with the machine.  It works great at first and is a fabulous toy, but even when cleaned regularly according to the enclosed instructions, it gets clogged and does not work after about 30 uses.  I had a big problem getting a new machine from Funrise but they did replace my defective machine six months later.The main reason I am posting this review is related to the price listed here - I got mine for about half this price.  Toys R Us sells them at their stores for a much more reasonable price."
nlp-input-text-275, "I bought this for my son, Christmas 2006, since he liked "helping" me clean the house.  The back of the vacuum tilts down just like the real thing, so he can "vacuum" under his bed.  There is a tiny button near the light that makes very realisitic vacuum humming.  My son uses his foot to turn it on and off, in an effort to copy me. I have not had to change the light bulb, and it runs on three AAA batteries.  I use rechargeable batteries, but I've only had to replace them once, despite how often my son uses it.  I know it's durable because I've caught my son stepping on the handle, when the back was laying flat, and it didn't crack or break.  When he is a little older, we will upgrade to theDirt Devil Toy Vacuum Jr., so he can be responsible for his own room.November 13, 2009Vacuum is still running great and my 4yr son still likes pretending to clean with it."
nlp-input-text-276, "My 2 yr old has had this bus for 1 yr and it is definitely a favorite. Not only is it educational all around from the letter phonics to the musical variations- but it is very durable-she has dropped it trying to transport it to the car so many times, it's a wonder how Leap Frog made something so toddler friendly and safe!"
nlp-input-text-277, "I love it! It is durable, goes great with our wooden LaLaLoopsy doll house, and is really cute. My daughters really enjoy playing with it. The basket on the end for a "pet bed" was a great idea, and the blanket and pillow are a cute pattern. It is easy to clean, just wipe down the bed and wash the pillow and blanket! The LaLaLoopsy dolls, large and small, fit nicely in the bed. Great buy!!"
nlp-input-text-278, "My son spent a solid 2 weeks playing this, and although it is has been sidelined for a few days (which I am actually happy about - seriously, if I heard &#34;Mom, I think I got it&#34; one more time Perplexus may have been the cause of a strangulation, lol) overall it is a fun &#34;game&#34; that keeps kids busy.  My son is 10 and although he did manage to get all 3 of the mazes rather quickly, it didn't stop him from trying over and over and OVER again.  Just like any toy, they do get bored and will move on to another but I have no doubt he'll be bringing this out again.  I have never mastered any of the mazes but I didn't spend 8 hours a day practicing either :)"
nlp-input-text-279, "We bought this after trying dominion. It has been an excellent game. The rules all taken together are complicated, but if you just play through a few turns the rules for each individual role are much more manageable.Excellent game."
nlp-input-text-280, "The trick requires concentration.  An adult may need to demonstrate first and read aloud the directions so the child can follow along.  If a dollar isn't available and thin sturdy piece of paper will also work."
nlp-input-text-281, "receive in a standard Amazon package in very good condition box height measured around 7 inches packaging of the figures is  very small perfect for Dragon Ball Z I keep my fingers MOC this is my first SH FiguArts and I'm really amazed doesn't speak volumes until you see  this figure up close and personal this  Super Saiyan Son Goku looks to cool  I have ordered already Super Saiyan 3 Son Gokou & Piccolo SDCC 2013 Exclusive and by the looks of this one I surely will not be disappointed"
nlp-input-text-282, "My girls (2 and 4) love this toy.  We haven't had the trouble other reviewers mentioned with the markers.  I've found the marker wipes off quite easily.  With a baby wipe, it even comes off of the wood part where it isn't intended to be used.  I was even able to get it off of my hardwood floor, and the marks had been there for an entire day before I noticed them.  This set has been an immediate favorite with my kids, who have a lot of other kitchen toys to choose from.  It's very durable; even the little paper cupcake liners are made of heavy paper, much thicker than real cupcake liners.  I do wish that Melissa and Doug toys still came with a lid for the storage box, other than, no complaints."
nlp-input-text-283, "I love spot it games, they are challenging even for adults, my 7 year old can beat me at this, but I still have to ease up a bit with my 4 year old, its not as easy for her, the 5 yr + get this game really good though, Its a game I will often give as a gift and just bought this one for a xmas gift for one of my daycare kids, as everyone gets a game this year. I highly recommend it, and love to play rounds with adults, its extra chellenging. It may seem like an easy concept, but when you are trying to beat someone to find a picture, it gets hard."
nlp-input-text-284, "I needed these for a little boy's birthday party.  I ordered PRIME, received the item, and there were only TWO DARTS, and ONE TARGET.  I emailed the company (NOT Amazon) immediately, didn't hear back in time, and had to return these.  The company blamed Amazon for the problem.. which is strange, since after about 10 years I have had one problem with Amazon.  Weird.Also, the product was odd, the target is INCREDIBLY small, and the suction cups didn't stick the first time, and only time, that we tried.  Maybe it's great, but not for us.  Bad deal, and for us, not a good product nor any fun."
nlp-input-text-285, "Need a lot of Play-Doh?  Than this is perfect for you!  I bought this and a big thing of cookie cutters to give as gifts at my daughters Birthday party.  Everyone seemed to be happy about it."
nlp-input-text-286, "My kids have always loved to use their imaginations and never needed lights and sounds to go with it!  This became an instant hit! Launch the rocket, let the astronauts go up in space, etc.  We even had Littlest Pet Shop trying to join in on their adventure! Solid construction and it's all green, so you can feel good about your purchase!  My toy testers were 3 and 4 years old so they already knew it was a rocket, etc.  However, if you use with a younger child, yes, you may have to sit and play with them and teach them about rockets, astronauts and space adventures!  Great lesson!  Everything in life is a teachable moment! Solid 5 stars for imaginative play, solid construction and being green in the USA!"
nlp-input-text-287, "He's been good about not losing the tender car but I liked how Gordon's coal car is connected but he's a pull and go type. Overall great toy."
nlp-input-text-288, "I got this Tamagotchi through the Vine review program.  I should disclose that I have never owned one of these, never played with one and I don't have much comparison between this and earlier versions which evidently were smaller.Here is my opinion.Set up was easy - I didn't bother to read the directions and I was able to get it "set up" with current date and time, name and birthday.Next the little animated character "hatched" and then I decided to look at the directions because pushing random buttons had no effect.  So then I figured out how to navigate through the tamagotchi "world".  Directions were easy and in under a minute I had navigated to a game called "cradle" where you drop things down on moving ledges and have to have the ledges catch the thing.So that was ok.  Not something I could do for hours but this would be quite distracting or entertaining for the younger set.  Maybe 8 year olds up to 12 year olds?  Maybe older - hard to know.Screen was easily readable.  The egg thing sits upright on it's own without a stand.  The little characters easily slide right on top of the egg and are anchored firmly.  I like the fact that the "door" is attached with a chain so you can't easily lose it.Takes 2 AAA batteries.  I don't know how long they will hold out since I just got this today.  All in all this would make a nice stocking stuffer or small gift for a kid.  I am sure they would have no problem playing this if I had no problem figuring it out."
nlp-input-text-289, "It is a light game, do not expect depth and years of strategic challenges, but when the right number of people are around a lunch table and wish to play something for 20 minutes or so, LL is hard to beat."
nlp-input-text-290, "These crowns are okay, but for a 4 year old that wants to stick foamies, jewels, letters and glitter on them, a little more surface area is needed.  There are bigger, and prettier ones that can be found at the chain craft stores for a good price, and I wish I had got those instead.  These did the trick, but there are better ones available.  They were a hit at her birthday party, and everyone liked decorating them, even a couple of adults.  They didnt' really wear them, even though I am sure they would have fit fine as the adjustable cord seems to be a great system for that."
nlp-input-text-291, "The Classroom Frankie playset doll is a lovely edition to my ever growing Monster High collection.  Her coffin locker is too cute."
nlp-input-text-292, "As other reviews state, this Ponyville Ferris Wheel Playset is basically a one-trick pony (haha!!!).  However, kids (both girls AND younger brothers, cousins, and neighbors) go crazy over this thing and will play with it for hours upon hours.  The ferris wheel is super cute and generously sized, considering how small the Ponyville figures are.  And, while the set only comes with one figure, the smaller ponies are pretty easy to find in giftsets.  We have been able to fit ponies and mermaid ponies into the seats, as well as my little pony stampers and figurines from other toy brands (Strawberry Shortcake, mini/baby Disney Princess, Toy Story figures, etc).This playset is fun and DEFINITELY worth the post-holiday sale prices - less than FIVE BUCKS over at TRU (the biggest toy story there is)!!! Granted, basic shipping bumps up the price, but it's still worth it considering what retail is.  Awesome gift "just because" or as a birthday surprise; just think of all the accolades you'll get when you bring this out of the gift closet!Just wish this had been around when *I* was 5 years old!!!"
nlp-input-text-293, "All little kids love monkeys.  And this is a fun engaging gamethat you can play, and its does not need batteries!  I like thecolorful pictures, and it is a safe toy for most young children."
nlp-input-text-294, "This product is completely adorable, but the rounded back makes it difficult for the child to stay on. Plus, my daughter has long legs and it sits quite low, so she was never actually able to use it--got it for her for her 1st bday and she couldn't stay on. Near her 2nd bday her legs were too long. Never got to enjoy it."
nlp-input-text-295, "Was a good price, but you get what you pay for. I was a little disappointed in the quality of this product."
nlp-input-text-296, "There is nothing more to say than the title.My 10-year-old granddaughter loves this and it remains set up in her room."
nlp-input-text-297, "This was a gift from Grandma for our 18 month old.  Our daughter figured out how to cut a few months later.  It's perfect for age two and up.  She loves to cut up all the fruits, veggies, and bread.  It comes with two cutting boards and two knives so a friend can play along too.  It keeps her entertained for a long time and, as others have mentioned, teaches her the names of a few fruits and veggies along the way.  Everything comes in a nice wooden box with a slide-on lid, which is great for storing all the pieces and for the fun of "in and out" of the box.  My only complaint is that the velcro stickers which hold the pieces together are not compeletly durable.  I've reglued a few of them, which has been no big deal to do.  Overall a great toy, well priced, and nicely made."
nlp-input-text-298, "This boombox is cute, but I have to agree with a lot of what I read in other reviews.  It would be nice if the figures came off the top, and it is pretty loud (which makes it pretty annoying most of the time).  I actually bought it to be used as part of a &#34;DJ Lance Rock&#34; costume for my husband for Halloween, it served that purpose really well!"
nlp-input-text-299, "Like the title says, there isn't much to this camera but my son still plays with it regularly.  There is one button on top that you can press and a couple of rolling balls on the front.  It plays a few tunes and says a few of phrases like "say cheese" or "smile".  It teaches a little about emotions like happy and sad and the switch on top says on and off and hello and goodbye.  I think it is okay for younger babies but it's a bit bulky.  It has a handle for carrying and a little light on the side.  I got it for my son when he was 12 months old because we were going on a trip and needed some new little things to keep him busy on the plane.  It didn't keep his attention for long but ever since we got home we keep it by his potty and he will play with it a little almost every day at potty time.  It's a good small toy but it just isn't that interesting for long at all.  I think it could have more to it but it probably would be more interesting to a 6 month old than my son."
