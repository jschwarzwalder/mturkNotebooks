At first she found it absolutly hysterical that when she pulled the string it follows her.  She loves pulling it around the house and its very sturdy and doesn't tip over all the time.  We have carpeting and hardwood floors and it works fine on both.  She has even taken it outside and it works well there too (on the sidewalk).  We have had this toy for over 2 months and my daughter enjoys it immensely.  I highly recommend it.  It's one of her favorite toys that she uses daily."
nlp-input-text-2, "Took me over 2 hours to assemble this toy...had to keep shooing my kid to the next room so she won't walk away with any of the pieces...Like everyone else who dislike the assembling part, I was quite disappointed to see a bunch of plastic pieces stuck together in "clusters" that I had to physically cut apart b4 attempting to assemble...this took FOREVER, not to mention finding the right piece that matches the instruction AND making sure after it's cut out that it doesn't get lost!!why couldn't the manufacturer put the modules together into larger, assembled pieces and all parents have to do is put together those modules (ie fridge, stove, microwave etc) onto the frame itself? Why make it so difficult for us to have to start "from scratch" in cutting out EACH INDIVIDUAL plastic piece from various clusters? And what I find even more terrible is that we have to also put those stickers that indicate where the switches are on the dish washer, microwave etc...can't they put that together b4 shipping it out?If it weren't for the price I would not have gotten this item. But even so, the saving is not enough to justify the time it takes to assemble this thing, especially when you have a kid waiting impatiently to play w/ it...I jammed several fingers w/ the screw driver as I was trying to keep my kid happy and assemble this thing at the same time..."

Good size for her hands and the other kids enjoy it, too. The strip around it makes it very unique and that's cool. Before it got really cold we played with it outside in dusk and it was a lot of fun. Easy to throw and catch. Plus, it's held up very well, even after being dropped - or thrown - onto the driveway several times! Highly recommend for younger ones especially."

nlp-input-text-9, "The Tonka Chuck & Friends Flip the Bounce Back Racer is okay for three- to six-year-olds but older children get bored quickly.  With two cars they could race them, but with one car, the fun is limited to bumping into things and chasing each other going backwards & forwards, either inside or on a hard surface outdoors, as there is no steering mechanism.It will run up a slope with enough speed and, with some practice, flip over, at least sometimes.  The car also speaks enthusiastically and the little ones loved that although I found it annoying after just a few minutes.The car and remote together take a total of eight AA batteries (which I was surprised to find are NOT included) so I suggest rechargeableeneloops.Overall, it is reasonably well-made for a plastic toy."
nlp-input-text-10, "I got this for my daughter at 10 months for Christmas.  She loved it then and still loves it, and she is 16 months old.  I like that she can stack the blocks, shake the blocks, and also pull the alligator behind her.  She likes the music and rolling the eyes of the alligator too.  I am not as crazy about the music, but it does play "it's raining it's pouring" and I think a couple of other songs.  She likes to also turn the alligator over and push the button on the bottom (little black button that is more apparent when the pull part is up)that turns off the current music and makes a strange wood block sound (sorry that is all I can compare it to).  So I hear a lot of noises on a daily basis from that thing.  She liked it a lot initially because she was into pushing cars around and now that she is older is is fun for her to have it trail after her.  She plays with it at least some way (playing with the blocks or pulling the 'gator) at least once a day.  I would suggest this to someone if their child is into pushing cars around on the floor or likes stacking blocks things on each other(of course they should be in the age group that this is intended).  It isn't for all children of course, but I realized what my child like doing and this was what I picked.  I definitely appreciate my choice, the only thing else I would like to note is that after over 8 months is that I have only changed the batteries once.  Which is not to bad in my book."

It comes in tiny pieces that all snap together, and it is very easy to get frustrated. The top two platforms aren't very secure and slide out when you move the castle. It took me about 30 minutes to fully assemble, which is kind of ridiculous.It only comes with one princess  and a small mouse that slide down the slide and spin. It's very cute and my daughter was highly entertained.The bottom platform also spins by using a small scissor like handle. It comes with a small bed and some dishes. Warning - the dishes are VERY small and are easily a choking hazard. This is definitely not for young toddlers and those that need supervision!"

nlp-input-text-16, "Every child should have this toy!!!  My kids outgrew this toy a long time ago (they are 5 and & now) and I always remembered it as one of the most played with toys when they were young.  It was one of my favorites.This thing lasted threw 2 toddlers, it has been dropped, kicked and thrown and it still worked until the day I gave it away to another child.  My kids would take it off of the fridge and carry it around like a boom box.  They both loved the song and I thought it was cute.HIGHLY recommend this toy.  My nephew will be one in August and I assure I will be giving him this toy for his first birthday."
nlp-input-text-17, "About a year ago I helped out at my Sunday school church in the third thru fifth grade class rooms and noticed a small crowd of mostly boys playing with this toy. They were pretty quiet as they were concentrating & working together to build a huge tower. I thought the toy looked interesting enough that I purchased it for my then 4 yr old boy that Christmas. Not only does he love to play with it, but I was really surprised that my 2 and a half year old boy loved it as well and was not too young to play with it. I had purchased the 230 piece set. Now, this Christmas coming up, I will give them the 400 piece set. This will enable them to build larger things. I absolutely recommend this toy. Children will play with it for many years before outgrowing it. We have some damage to several of the straws only because our kitten chewed on them. Plan on buying a plastic tub to keep the pieces in, as the box it comes in is pretty cheap. Great toy for creating 3D cages the kids can climb into, cubes, and towers that can block off entire doorways. After almost a full year, my boys still love this toy."
nlp-input-text-18, "I got this for my son's first Christmas, which was a mistake.  He was too young but the older kids loved it.  One of the older kids loved it too much and discovered that the mallet, which has very square corners, could be used to make delightful dents in drywall.  And then in the process of the wreckertons playing with it, one of the wooden ramps inside came out (we could have glued it back in promptly and it would have been fine, but then it disappeared, as toys do) and the yellow ball went AWOL.  So now we are missing a ball and a ramp.  I put the toy away for a while, got it out again a few months ago - baby was 20 or 21 months old.It's a GREAT toy.  I'd say ideal for 18m and up.  It takes just enough resistance to pound the balls through the holes that it is the right balance between challenging and rewarding.  It makes a nice clackity sound as the ball rolls through - even minus a ramp.  Simple means of teaching colors and numbers 1-4 to a very young child.  Just plain fun for a little one.My daughter seems to have outgrown her hunger for destroying drywall so that's good.  We haven't lost any more ramps so just that one must have been loose - it's totally and easily fixable if you have this issue, you just need to do it before you lose it."

However, it was faded and not missing pieces unlike what has happened with some other temporary tattoos."

Although it's an easy toy to set aside and forget about, she really likes playing with it when she comes across it. It works great as a magnifying glass, but is sturdy and safe (not made of glass). It doesn't magnify a huge amount, but enough to make a difference, especially for a small child. I highly recommend it for any curious little one!"

nlp-input-text-31, "I'm very thankful for the previous reviews as this led us to purchase this item.It is AWESOME!  We added it to the Thomas Water Tower Figure 8 set. The bridge on that set kept coming apart & so we decided to add this & am so glad we did!Not only do the wooden Thomas trains fit on this so do some miscellaneous mini cars.  We had some Tonka cars we bought from KOHL's & they fit perfectly (NOTE: on Amazon I'm pretty sure this is the item in case you want to buy them as they are really cute & fun for toddlers: Tonka: Chuck and Friends Train Fleet).  So they can play w/ both the trains & the cars.  Not all cars will, but some do.This has been very educational.  They learn to put the track together & that for the trains to zoom out the door they have to have them @ the top & let go.  They can have multiple trains together too.  As other reviewers have noted, toddlers for some reason want to put things in upward/backwards through the door.  I think this is just a learning phase which is neat to watch.  They are figuring it out. So far, we haven't had anything get stuck or anything & hopefully won't in the future.I am so glad I purchased this & it is our favorite piece we've bought so far for the Thomas tracks."

Then he tore into the puzzle and had it done in about 15-20 minutes.  He has redone it at least 5 or 6 times since.  I am trying to get him to share it with his pre-K class but he declines - afraid they won't give it back!  It is really a lot of fun as the pieces are big and the picture is not too complicated."
nlp-input-text-34, "My 4-year-old grandson is addicted to all things superhero, and one of his favorite heroes is Spiderman. This plastic plane was an instant hit -- and best of all, it required NO batteries as it has no electronics (which is getting rare in toys these days). The plane is the perfect size for him to &#34;fly&#34; while running around the house and the clear plastic canopy lifts up to put Spiderman inside the cockpit. The figure lays down on its back in the plane and is larger than usual in size making it easy for little fingers to grip.The two shooting &#34;projectiles&#34; provided a lot of enthusiasm -- they click into each front wing and when the button is pressed, the two soft plastic pieces are shot from the plane fairly gently and without a lot of velocity from their ports. He loved it --  and there's not much chance of those plastic projectiles hurting anyone or causing damage. In addition, when you squeeze its legs, Spiderman's hand shoots out mimicking a web strike. We were able to imagine lots of dangerous missions for hours of fun.This toy looks very durable and I love that it makes no noise! I'm sure he will enjoy it for a long time. I did notice his little brother (age 1) had his eye on it too!"

Upon first appearance they look soft and cuddly and they are to a point, but with the mechanics inside the middle is hard. It has three modes:  1.Singing  2.Harmony 3.Chatter.  I thought them singing Hello Ma Baby was adorable and I love their teeth. That is a funny, cute feature. I'm sure children will love them as well. The only problem  with the song was that you have to keep pushing to hear the song. A smaller child may never get through it. The song was very clear however.  The chatter was just that chatter, but I assume a child would giggle at it. I think this is different and children like different. It certainly seems that it would entertain a little one and  keep them entertained."

It doesn't feel like the cheap plastic stuff you tend to find in stores these days. This also brought back childhood memories of the Little People Treehouse from the 70s for me. Play value is excellent. My 10 year old absolutely loved everything about the cute little dolls with button eyes and the neat stitch-work look of the trees. The little elevator, donut swing, etc. will keep your child entertained. The detail in the play-set looks like it's been sewn together giving you the idea of a home-made toy. It's not as small as it looks either. You get quite a bargain in the parts/accessories that come within the set. It is by no means chintzy. Best of all, we didn't have the hassle of crazy assembly. Hands down, this will be an excellent gift for any child ages 5 & up that are interested in the Lalaloopsy dolls."

nlp-input-text-42, "This is the sweetest doll I've seen in a long time. She is a combination of the traditional, huggable baby doll and technology. There are 150+ actions, sounds & phrases. She actually responds to touch. She's a great way to distract "mommy" out of a cranky mood. It's hard to be cranky when this doll says all those loving phrases and needs attention.The electronics make it difficult to dress and undress her. They also make her a little 'hard' and less huggable.She has an adorable voice and a sweet disposition. How can a doll have a sweet disposition? The things she says and does. "I love you, bear! You're the best bear in the whole world!" (and she kisses the bear with a loud kissing noise), and "I love you THIS much (and her arms go out to show you how much she loves you." Nice eye lashes!She works on magnets and 4 AA batteries, batteries included. One plus for me is the fact that she doesn't seem to "require" more accessories. I went to their web site at littlemommy.com and there are plenty of accessories, but the doll does fine without them. If you want to buy the stroller, pony, bed, shopping cart, bath & training set, high chair, play pen, and/or crib, they are available, but definitely not necessary. This doll comes with enough accessories to keep a child busy and happy. I would suggest counting the accessories and having a special storage place for them at the end of the day. Otherwise you will be pulling long searches for a spoon or Bandaid, because your child won't want to be without them.Positives: This is such an adorable doll!Negatives: There are none. I love her already.Make sure not to lose the bear, juice pop, wash cloth, head band,  band aid (which looks like a plastic bracelet), dish, and spoon. I would advise open the box very carefully, from the back side of the box, as designed. That makes things much easier to clip and remove.EDITED after 2 days of listening to her constant chatter. The adults were all joking about her maniacal laugh. Lots of jokes about wasn't she the doll in the horror movie, etc, but the children ignored the jokes and kept running to feed her and fix her 'owee' and give her bear to her whenever she talked. SHE HAS AN ON-OFF SWITCH and we did use it.  :)"

nlp-input-text-44, "I had reservations on this toy, but am happy I bought it b/c it is really fun! It is like an update to the old favorite Transformers. Transformers are still loved; however, I do like that these have sound. And, the switch back & forth between the vehicle & the dinosaur is EXTREMELY easy which is appreciated so little one's can enjoy this too. The quality is excellent. The wheels on the car roll really smoothly & each part clicks/pops/changes into it's spot really easily. I first bought the blue Triceratops so far, but after seeing how much fun & enjoyment this is bringing I bought the other's as well & am just as happy w/ them. It is good to have several of them to "race".  If you do have any of the Transformers, these change back & forth very similarly; however, I did notice a big difference in the ease of doing so. And, these stay in their positions better. By that I mean if you click to a car then it is solidly the car & vice versa. Whereas, on the Transformers, we have a hard time getting them to stay in either postion. The head would pop-up/etc. These VTech Switch & Go Dinos are wonderful. I highly recommend & have bought all 4 offered. Price is in line w/ the quality & fun of the toy. Pleasant surprise. I'm not an expert, but I think this would be a good toy for 2 1/2 & older. If given younger, they will need help & you do need to watch they don't get their fingers pinched, but as they grow into them they will be able to do on their own & have a blast. It is fun to see them race these & I know I noted it above already, but I was very happy about how smooth the wheels roll. That seems like an odd thing to point out, but it is appreciated when car toys roll really well & don't make sounds/seem to get stuck or don't roll smoothly - so hard to put into words, but I think you'll know what I mean when you roll this - just really smooth. The actual toy itself does make really cool racing sounds though while in the car position & the Triceratops makes cool growling/etc noises. Great toy for BOTH boys & girls who enjoy cars, racing, Transformers, dinosaurs, etc."

Assorted (and finely detailed!) tiles about 40 in number can be drawn by two to five players from a box. The player then connects the tile to the main board, where the depictions of grass, castle and road drawings must correspond to other adjacent tiles. Once a tile is placed, the player may place a piece on the board, and these men help the player garnish points through completing streets, castles, monasteries or fields. The fun of the game involves the luck of the draw and the strategy of whether to build up your creations or make it difficult for the other participating players.My wife and I laid the foundation for our relationship while playing this game during our courtship, and we continue to play in our marriage.

I also purchased the Melissa and Doug Easel Accessory set and I am glad that I did. I saw that some people complained about the Accessory set but I thought that it was worth the money because I didn't have to go through the hassle of looking for paper, paint cups, paint,  brushes, eraser, etc, etc. from somewhere else. The only other thing is that  I wish that I would have bought the Melissa and Doug Artist's Smocks, too. I had bought two at one of my local dollar stores for $1 each, and one of them broke on the first use. I wish that I would have just paid the 9 bucks to have one that would hopefully last longer."

I placed the 70mAh battery under the belly directly under the main rotor shaft. This did extend the flight time and made the helicopter very stable and even easier to fly.  I splice and solder the 70mAh battery with the stock battery. See pics to see both batteries installed. I did this as a temporary modification until I did the upgrade with 3.7V Lithium Polymer 240 mah Battery. Once the 240 mah Battery came in, I'd installed it and removed both 70mah and stock 150mah batteries. Then I notice better speed and performance. Great helicopter to fly."

In many of the Barbies over the last few years this was often typified by replacing doll and costume quality with gimmickry, and I'm happy to see the Pink Shoes collection is much better made.This transforming Kristyn doll uses a clever mechanic to reverse the skirt from purple-blue Odette/Giselle-inspired storyline skirt to the full pink Barbie-esque one that Kristyn wears at the end.  I had concerns about whether the doll would survive my overly-enthusiastic 6yo and 3yo, but they've had her for a couple months of regular play and she's still fine (a serious accomplishment, actually).While they did pose Kristyn's hands and feet in ballet pose, they made her knees straight.  I thought that strange since both theGiselleandOdettedolls have bendable knees that, when pushed into pli&eacute;, cause them to entrechat like Kristyn does in the movie.  You'll also notice from those two dolls that this "transforming" Kristyn doesn't really look like either of them when changed.  Fortunately kids at that age are full of imagination, and that sort of petty detail is solidly in the realm of grown-up gripe.For my girls, Barbie's transformation and the fun they have acting out scenes fromthe movieis as magical as the source stories.

Definitely as tough as advertised, which is amazing. It's easy to use. It's got a swiveling lens so your child can take a self-portrait, which is really neat and provides lots of entertainment. It's got an auto-shut-off feature, which is wonderful because my son always leaves his toys on, draining the batteries.- The Bad: well, if you're looking for professional quality pictures, you'll be disappointed. My son doesn't care about this. If you do, don't get this camera. Also, the camera makes noises when buttons are pressed, and (as far as I know) you can't turn these off, so you may not want to have Junior play with this during a wedding or something. Finally - really, Fisher-Price, you couldn't have thrown in a cheapie USB cable? Shame.All in all, this is a fun toy and a great way to get your child interested in taking pictures. Despite some reservations on my part, it's sure to be a hit with younger children, especially ones who have shown an interest in using your camera."

Younger children are able to color because the markers do not color on anything except the special paper--not on clothes, kids, furniture or walls.  Perfect for travelling and anytime something is needed to entertain young children."
nlp-input-text-59, "My son loves this &#34;fire smasher&#34; - he calls it.  I don't like it becuase I feel each disc should make a different sound - they all make the same noise. But my son doesn't notice and really likes it. A friend brought over a sword and the two seem compatible (they fit together). Didn't know that so that was a fun surprise if you're in the market for two toys. Decent quality and I don't think I paid that much for it. So good buy, I suppose."
nlp-input-text-60, "Leapster is a wonderful, durable and entertaining product for young children. The finding Nemo cartridge has kept my 5 year old grand daughter captivated, entertained for hours. While many of the cardridges are very learning skills focused, this catridge emophasizes fun, humor and helping others. Battery life is excellent even when played for hours at a time. The unit survives the beating of a two year old sister without a hitch. The game and cartridge are well suited for a five year old."
nlp-input-text-61, "My grandson loves it. I thought it looked bigger in the picture, but that didn't seem to matter to him!"
nlp-input-text-62, "My granddaughter loves anything puppy so this will be perfect for her.  It is very well made and I really love it.  I was surprised at how tiny it is though.  Guess I didn't check the measurements and for the price I couldn't expect much more."
nlp-input-text-63, "This is a Great gift for any 1-5 year old. It is a little advanced for a one year old, BUT still a great toy to have at any age. It teaches counting, sings happy birthday and you can &#34;blow&#34; the candles out. Very cute!"
nlp-input-text-64, "These are as cute as the picture shows.  The plastic is soft and colorful and should keep my grabby little one busy for at least a few minutes.  Maybe more."
nlp-input-text-65, "These are a set of dice with various pictures on each side, such as a sleeping face, a turtle, or an arrow.These work as ice breakers, as a storytelling game component, or as a way to get kids rolling dice and making up stories.  They aren't really a game themselves as much as a tool.If you want something to help people talk, or to constrain storytelling, these work great."
nlp-input-text-66, "Thats all...its awesome. My 9 month old cant get enough of it. We actually love the spanish version better than english, seems to flow better. I think it has helped my daughter stand faster and longer because she was so interested in it."
nlp-input-text-67, "I am a puzzle maniac, having assembled jigsaw puzzles from 100 to 9000 pieces (a 13200 pieces is in the queue and I am really going to the 18,000 and 32,000 pieces from Ravensburger in the future...). Some of them were 3D puzzles, like the Taj Mahal, US Capitol, Neuschwanstein Castle, Big Ben, etc. This one in particular is a very high quality product from Ravensburger (as usual), all the pieces have an excellent finishing and they stick together very well. I usually assemble this size of puzzles in Foam Boards. They are very light and conveniently cheap. The foam board being 3/16'' (5mm) gives your puzzle enough support. I usually cut the board (easily done with a cutter) after glueing the puzzle, leaving a border of 1'' at each side, so I can pin the board in my garage (that, at this point, is full of puzzles...). For puzzles 5,000 pieces and larger I usually go with a 4'x8'x5/32'' plywood that I pre-cut at the size of the puzzle plus 1 inch extra on each side... This is heavier and a little more expensive, but gives better support and for that size of puzzle I need that extra support. You might be able to accommodate up to a 6,000 piece in one of those 4'x 8' (feet) boards. So far I have assembled 2 x 5,000 pieces, 1 x 6,000, 1 x 8,000 pieces and 1 x 9,000, besides dozens of 3,000 and smaller. What help me a lot is that my wife and daughters also like the challenge, so we move fast. A 1,000 piece puzzle do not last a weekend, although the 8,000 piece one took us 2 months (most 2 to 3 hours at night work) to put together. This one in particular took us 5 days to put together, as it has a good amount of sky and the reflections are never easy. I highly recommend Ravensburger products for the excellent quality to everyone that enjoys challenges alone or with the whole family. It is a guaranteed entertainment for hours, listening to music or talking in family environment.Amazon.com was kind enough to provide this product for me through their Vine Program for reviewing and I was not request to provide a positive review. Opinions expressed here are my own."

nlp-input-text-69, "This is a great game for any age! We have played many games now! I can see a little wear in the dice, the pictures are flat on the dice rather than in-dented like normal dice. The score card unfolds to make a larger one. Everything fits inside the "?" box when finished playing."
nlp-input-text-70, "This was a Christmas gift for my 18mo. old daugher and she loves it.  It's a bit tricky and difficult to put together but with a bit of upper body strength and some determination you can accomplish it.  I love that it's sturdy, so when my daughter stands in it I don't have to worry about her toppling over."
nlp-input-text-71, "My boys 10, 9, 7 & 4 love building with zoobs. The toys themselves are are very sturdy... the case however is cheap. It broke within hours. We also overpaid by $30. :( I see they are $55 now... much better price. Either way they are a great toy, with hours of fun!"
nlp-input-text-72, "My sons were excited when they started playing with the Spiderman Stunt Buggy.  They discovered the magnetic part in the back that could hold spiderman.  Then they discovered that it could flip and spent a whole afternoon playing with it. Unfortunately by the next day the flip mechanism stopped working, it's the most fun part of the buggy you think the manufacturers would make it more durable.  Piece of junk!"
nlp-input-text-73, "These wooden toys are perfect for my day care kids.  The quality is good.  Love the look of the toy"
nlp-input-text-74, "My daughter received these for her birthday, along with the castle. Both of my daughters love playing with the set and have a great time pretending they are princesses too.The only problem I have found is that two of the princesses have split personalities. Snow White seems to think she is both Snow White and Jasmine. Rapunzel seems to think she is Rapunzel and Ariel. Now, since we have Ariel, my daughter asked if it is okay that Rapunzel also thinks that she is Ariel. I asked and Ariel doesn't seem to mind. However, since we don't have Jasmine, I think Snow White is safe from ridicule for the time being!"
nlp-input-text-75, "We got this for our 5yr old grandson to carry his Leapster GS in for Christmas. We really like it. He is not a gentle little fellow and we have not had any problems with it. It nicely carries his 2 game cartridges inside and he loves to take it with us when wego out in the car or to something that would be boring for him."
nlp-input-text-76, "I bought this toy for my daughters 3rd birthday and it is in the bathtub everytime she takes a bath and she shows no interest in it what so ever. the boots character i threw away due to mold and my daughter hasn't even noticed. I don't recall a tree being attached to it i'll have to look again. I am thinking about actually taking this to the pool to see if she will play with it there."
nlp-input-text-77, "Our girls love this!!  They are 2 and 4 and love this camera. They were constantly getting mine out of my purse and I said no more!  I found this one and bought it based on reviews and we are very happy. They really enjoy taking pictures. And they like the little add ons you can add to pictures. Super cute!!"
nlp-input-text-78, "The TRIO Hot Wheels Stunt Ramp Builder set is super cool.  The TRIO blocks are easy to build with, they just snap together and stick in place.  While this set starts at ages 3 and up, I will say it does take an adult to help build the sets but kids can of course play around with snapping the pieces together.  There are different configurations you can build which make for more fun it gives you lots of options!Once the set was built it stayed up pretty well.  I was able to pick it up and move it around without it coming apart.  Now of course if you don't handle it properly the pieces will come apart, but it just add to the fun by rebuilding it.  It is the perfect size for kids and my boys (3 and 4) really got a kick out of it.  They now want more of the TRIO blocks to play with and I even found that there are other TRIO Hot Wheels sets you can add in.  You do get a green Hot Wheels car that you build with the TRIO blocks but my boys also include their other regular Hot Wheels cars.Overall, this set is great for any Hot Wheels fan.  You get the fun of not only building your stunt sets but then by playing with it.  You get tons of pieces and the instructions show clear pictures of how to build the sets."

nlp-input-text-80, "Since my 8 year old grand daughter loves the Warriors series,  I was glad to see this Cats Toob available on Amazon  (couldn't find it in stores).  She figured out which ones look like the cats in the books.  Maybe she'll give the others names worthy of a Warriors cat and write her own story for them."
nlp-input-text-81, "Mattel's Movie Masters Batman has a great amount of detail to him. His sculpt is great, his paint is pretty good, and his articulation is really good.Batman's sculpt is based off his appearance in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. This design has become my favorite of the Batman designs, and the mold does an excellent job recapturing it. The one thing I don't like about it is that the cape is made of a pretty sturdy plastic, which gets in the way of his posing.He has a really nice paint job, at least for what it's supposed to be. Obviously, his suit is almost completely black, so you're not going to see a whole lot of coloring. However, Mattel went the extra mile and gave him multiple shades of black, so it doesn't look boring. The only thing I would have changed paint-wise is that his pupils are a solid black. This is the only thing that makes it seem like a bigger version of their 3 3/4&#34; action figures. I think it would have been better if they had eye color to them.His articulation is very good. He is able to move pretty much everywhere. As I already stated, the only problem is the fact that his cape gets in the way of posing him.The only other problem I have with him is his accessories, or rather his lacking of them. As an adult collectible, you would think he would feature a lot of cool things to display him with. Sadly, this is not the case. The only thing he comes with is a stand for the build-a-batsignal feature. This entire system feels gimmicky and childish for an adult collector's toy line.Though it's not perfect, the Movie Masters Batman is probably the best plastic depiction of the film incarnation of the character yet. I recommend this to any collector who loves watching the Dark Knight trilogy."
nlp-input-text-82, "Made out of heavy duty plastic, this set includes a Large Smurf house, which was very easy to assemble, a small Gargamel figure and the smurfs, including Papa and Smurfette. I only wish Gargamel was larger than the Smurfs, more true to form."
nlp-input-text-83, "This toy is very fun for spatially inclined people and mathematicallycurious people. The Soma Cube idea is far more difficult than pentominosbecause of 3-Dimensional irregular shapes. I know for me, with many ofthese challenges I am almost close but am one block off-target. Nevertheless,it is still a good solitary brain teaser since regardless of spatial abilityit does improve spatial perception."
nlp-input-text-84, "My wife and I were looking for a relatively simple (and portable) game we could take with us on overnight trips to visit family and on vacations.  So, we decided to give &#8220;Square Shooters The first deck of cards on dice&#8221; a try.  My wife played the game with oou eight year old son.  Below are her comments:This is a terrific new idea for avid card players.  If you are ready for something different, there are plenty of variations to keep you busy with this card/dice set.  Recommended ages are 8 and up, but I think it&#8217;s only appropriate at that age if your child is already familiar with card games like rummy.  But I would put this on the &#8220;great gift&#8221; list for ages 10 and up.  Four stars."
nlp-input-text-85, "This is a cute little doll that is sturdy. She is kind of funny with her huge head and tiny body.It says the doll is for 5+yr olds. This must be for the use of the computer and the tiny shoes. Mine will be played with by a 2.5yr old and she is fine with not putting things in her mouth.I went online and checked out the activities and they are educational. You choose your doll, only one. You can play games and there are lessons on playing nice and recycling items, things like that. I played one game on the easy level with the musical notes...lol a 5 yr old could probably do better than I did. There are little video's to watch also. Very child friendly but it does require going online, without that it is just a little doll.My biggest disappointment is that Makayla Song doll loves music and plays the guitar. You only get the cardboard one that is part of the package. I think they could have included a little plastic guitar maybe instead of the charm.Over all it is cute and it has the bonus of some good morals taught online about living in our world being nice to it and to each other."
nlp-input-text-86, "Truth be Told is an excellent party game.  The game encourages good conversations. Truth be Told is best played with good friends and is a fun way to get to known your friends even better.On your turn you write down your answer to the question asked. At the same time the other players write down what they think your answer will be. The other players could write down serous or funny answers. You than collect all of the cards and read them aloud, including yours. The other players than guess the answer they think is your answer. Points are award to anyone who had their question picked as the correct answer.I recommend Truth be Told to anyone looking for a fun new party game."

nlp-input-text-89, "As usual, Eeboo does a wonderful job with this game.  The pictures are fantastic - a work of art.  The pieces are thick and durable.  It's appealing and inviting.  We also have the Hasbro "Original Memory Game," which has SEVENTY tiny cards with treacly, goofy cartoons on them, and I find it incredibly annoying.  The Life on Earth memory game is light years better - creative, artistic, thicker pieces, just much nicer overall.  Worth a few dollars more."

nlp-input-text-91, "This is a nice puzzle that offers can occupy a child for a while, provided a child has enough patience, or serve as a quick child-parent game.  Puzzle pieces are made of thick plastic, they fit snugly, and the completed puzzle is sturdy.  The puzzle comes with a display stand.  The puzzle is about as challenging as a LEGO set, because both provide instructions on what to do.My 4 1/2 year old son and I put this puzzle together in about 30 minutes.  In the beginning I was sorting pieces and he was assembling the puzzle.  All pieces are numbered and have directional arrows showing where the next piece goes.  It was pretty easy for my son to assemble to piece #100, at which point he started looking for piece #200 because he only knew how to count in hundreds past 100.  So, I explained to him that after 100 comes 101, which I thought to be a nice teaching moment.By this point, I have already sorted all pieces and arranged them in groups of ten.  I began assembling the puzzle beginning with the piece #130 and up.  When my son installed piece #129, we joined the part he was assembling with the part that was assembled by me and then quickly finished the remaining 20 or so pieces.The result was a pretty colorful and sturdy ball showing a picture of the NY Times Square at night."
nlp-input-text-92, "My kids love this thing but I hate it. When it works it works great but when it clogs or jams I just want to toss it out the window. We take this thing apart (the gear section) regularly to get out clogged playdoh or unstick jammed gears. I think this toy was a great concept/idea with exceptional potential but the execution of the gear section is just terrible.  Great fun (when it works) for kids but a total frustration for parents. If you get this make sure you keep your screwdriver handy at all times....you will need it."
nlp-input-text-93, "It broke down in the very first use. Just putting the batteries. I could not connect it. This is a waste of money."
nlp-input-text-94, "I was a bit skeptical about this puzzle, namely how sturdy it was going to be, and how easily the structure would hold its shape.  That said, the Puzzleball was fun to put together, and holds up really well.  The pieces are hard plastic, and generally fit quite well with each other.  The ball holds its shape nicely while you build it, although putting the last pieces in (the north or south pole, depending on how you started) is a bit trickier, since you can only push from the inside.  You can build it two ways.  The easier way is by using the numbers on the back of each piece, and the harder way is by visually fitting the pieces, like any normal puzzle.  Due to the 3D nature and abundance of blue pieces, this second method is more of a challenge, especially for younger puzzlers.  The globe comes with two display stands- the rotating arm shown on the box, or a simpler saucer-type stand to allow picking up, etc.  The maps is full of fun little details and while is hardly cartographer-grade material, it's perfect for kids.  Recommended."
