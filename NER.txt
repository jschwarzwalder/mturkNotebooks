customer_review_1,"I generally use Pampers Sensitive baby wipes, but ordered these instead because I found a better deal. It made me remember why I prefer pampers... Huggies rips much easier. I run a home daycare, and change a lot of dirty diapers every day, nobody enjoys when a baby wipe rips and you get baby poop on you! These wipes are very soft, but I do not prefer them."
customer_review_2,"I ordered this toilet paper thinking it was comparable to the Cottonelle tp sold at a membership warehouse store. . However, the tp I received is a mere 64 g per roll vs. the warehouse store Cottonelle rolls that weigh in at a hefty 119 g per roll, nearly twice the weight! What I thought was a good price was a total rip-off."
customer_review_3,"Excellent, solid built cable with compact head.  Unfortunately this does NOT fit into a Lifeproof case for an iPhone 6 Plus.  I fault that case more than the cable. The tolerance on that particular case is WAY too tight.  It barely fits the OEM Apple cable.  I call this out in the review because the advertisement here on Amazon shows this product being used with a lifeproof case."

customer_review_5,"I purchased these Towbows and Copic Markers and had designers test and compare them before buying several sets for everyone, and here is the breakdown:  Tombow PROs: * Good value for the money * Lots of color choices * Don\'t bleed through regular paper (this is important, as we often just have regular paper around for quick design sketches) * Brush + Chisel is nice (note: chisel point is pretty small)  Tombow CONs: * Not as many colors choices in the spectrum for the two sets we purchased (set of 10 versus 12 with the Copic Markers) * Biggest issue:  Overlapping strokes leave very dark portions that are hard to smooth out * Don\'t seem to blend as well as the Copics  In the end, these are just fine for quick sketches, which is what we mostly do, but for more serious artwork or a final version, the Copic Markers used on proper paper are the way to go."
customer_review_6,"Bring your photographic subjects closer with this Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS Image Stabilizer Telephoto Zoom Lens. It is designed with Canon\'s Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon\'s 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max. Diameter - x Length 2.8 in. x 4.3 in./70 x 108mm (maximum lens length) Weight - 13.8 oz./390g Canon 1 year limited warranty"
customer_review_7,"FCC Chairman Newton Minow termed television a Vast Wasteland in his famous 1961 speech. Ironic since the era of talking horses, genies, witches, favorite martians and castaways had not yet even begun. Throw in the secret agent craze of the mid-sixties and you have one of the most fondly remembered periods in TV history.

customer_review_9,"We were recommended this restaurant by our rickshaw driver, we were slighty reluctant at first but once we got there we were made to feel welcome. Staff are friendly and welcoming and the food is delicious with excellent service. We would recommend this restaurant if staying in Alappuzha!"
customer_review_10,"Found this Hotel on Trip Advisor. Excellent value. Very well located Hotel that is within walking distance to most sights. Took the advice on TA and signed up for the free Kimpton Club before we went. Do not pay extra for upgrades they send you prior to arriving. We were upgraded to a larger room immediately upon arrival. Everyone was very friendly. Room was large and clean. We had a couple small issues which I brought up nicely the next morning. The staff bent over backwards to make us happy and address our needs. I could not have been happier with the service and friendliness of the staff. Very helpful concierge"
